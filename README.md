Homebrew-dupes
==============
These formulae duplicate software provided by OS X, though may provide more recent or bugfix versions.

How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap homebrew/dupes` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from Homebrew/homebrew or another tap, you can `brew install homebrew/dupes/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes/master/<formula>.rb
```
